      <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Sanskar, your Health & Life Coach at Mind Matters.</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m here to help you feel more confident, clear-minded, and in control
        of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started Mind Matters because Iâ€™ve seen how powerful it is when
        people stop surviving and start thriving. With professional training
        and a deep passion for helping others, I guide my clients through the
        mental and emotional blocks that hold them back â€” whether itâ€™s stress,
        self-doubt, unhealthy habits, or simply feeling stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is calm, caring, and practical. Together, we work toward
        real change â€” not perfection, but progress. Because you deserve to
        feel good in your mind, your body, and your life.
